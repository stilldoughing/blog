I make naturally leavened bread using 100% wholemeal flour that I mill at home with a Mockmill 200.

### More Information

I became one of those *pandemic sourdough guys*, but my path felt empty.  I took no memorable lessons on any part of the process from any book-- even the most well-regarded and popular books on sourdough (new and old), which routinely name-dropped in forums and other sites. 

I learned by watching lots of youtube video.  A handful of blogs/sites of note helped tremendously.

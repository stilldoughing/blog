My experiences baking sourdough bread using **only** water, salt and  100% wholemeal flour milled at home with a Mockmill 200 grain mill

### In a nut

Using *freshly-milled* flour as the total grain bill presented some challenges to my desire to produce a lofty loaf of bread.  I will write about the ones I encountered and do my best to cross reference with published science on the subject.

#### More later -- but not *that* much later hopefully

I will add some background about this passion of mine for context. Cobbling together my daily baking notes into something resembling a journal-- hopefully a helpful one for those of wishing to explore this-- is on the top of my to-do list.

I make naturally leavened bread using 100% wholemeal flour that I mill at home with a Mockmill 200.

## A little background

I became one of those *pandemic sourdough guys*, but my path felt empty.  I took no memorable lessons on any part of the process from any book-- even the most well-regarded and popular books on sourdough (new and old), which routinely name-dropped in forums and other sites.

Since sourdough became such a *thing* during early and mid-high pandemic, every content farm out there published
recipes, how-to guides and warm fuzzies on how "It's really no biggie!  Just follow my instructions because I hav
e cracked the code."

### Factoid

Nobody broke the code.  No code existed to break.  Bread may as well have been produced along with hydrogin in the big bang it feels so old.  A product of the Neolithic revolution, the process of producting a leavend loaf of bread underwent  countless iterations of trail and error, observation and documentation spanning not just generations, but *ages*.  Some of the earliest science that begain to cleave to a basic *scientific method* studied bread.  For grins, search for schollary articles about bread and look for references to articles published near the turn of the 21th century!


I learned by watching lots of youtube video.  A handful of blogs/sites of note helped tremendously.  I made lots of mistakes, which became bags of croutons for our friends.  I struggled with the most basic *target* loaf-- an image of the quintessential, rustic loaf I we all saw, and maybe continue to see

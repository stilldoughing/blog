Stay tuned.  On this site I will post about my experiences with making 100% wholemeal sourdough bread using flour that I mill myself with a Mockmill 200 grain mill.

--Just a teaser below about one of the aspects of sourdough bread baking that has consumed me-- so you, gentle reader, may get some idea of the depth of my diseased passion--

I use absolutely no white flower anymore for anything I bake.  I don't sift, bolt or add dough enhancers with one caveat.  I make and use my own diastatic malt powder.  I sprout wheat berries and kiln dry them at a low temperature.  I add about 2% to to the total grain bill.  I'm still not convinced that this has significantly enhanced browning in my bread.  However, scientific writing on the subject supports my experience that adding wheat-derived amylase as a dough component can help increase dough volume (a challenge with 100% wholmeal bread) and delay starch retrogradation (stalling) in the final product.
